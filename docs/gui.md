# depthmapX Graphical User Interface

The graphical user interface is the standard way of interacting with depthmapX.
It allows to load files, import plans, runs analyses and explore the data in
an interactive way.

A lot of the available functionality has been described in the [Depthmap Manual 
for Dummies](./DepthmapManualForDummies-v13.pdf) by Akkie van Nes, which is slightly
outdated but still worth a read to get an idea how things work in the GUI.
